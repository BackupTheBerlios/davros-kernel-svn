"ROM Monitor"

The Makefile target "bin/monitor" should build a rudimentary ROM
monitor. However, I've never even attmpted to locate it in the
ROM, so I've no idea if it will even run, let alone do anything
useful. I've started testing it in RAM, so I know that at least it
gives a prompt, and one or two of the commands appear to work
too.
