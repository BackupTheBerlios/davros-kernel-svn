To compile the programs, you need to have the GNU CC for Tricore
installed. All the development work has been carried out on
a Linux host, but should also work on Solaris provided you
have GNU Make installed.

To build the programs:

1. Unpack the archive into a suitable directory. If you're
reading this file, you've probably already done that.

2. Edit the Makefile in the top level directory. Change the
names of the assembler, compiler and linker (AS, CC and LD)
to match your compiler.

3. In the top level directory, type "make bin/davros" for the
kernel + qdf interpreter or "make bin/kerntest" for the kernel test
suite. The binaries (in the bin directory) can then be loaded into the
CPU and started.

4. Have fun!
