The programs in this archive are intended for use on the
Tricore CPU family. Currently the only supported hardware
is the Triboard development platform fitted with a TC10GP
CPU, although support for other Tricore platforms could
be added fairly easily.

All the programs are located at 0xa8010000, so should be
loadable under a standalone boot loader or through
a JTAG debugger.

Why Tricore?
============

1. I have access to one for development.

2. The CPU and its EABI aren't very tolerant of commonly-
made but questionable assumptions about parameter passing, so
if the code runs on Tricore it should run on most other CPUs.
