This archive contains Davros, QDF (Quick and Dirty Forth) compiler
and interpreter for the Tricore TC10GP processor (Triboard).
There's also a rudimentary (and mostly untested) monitor
program.

History (newest first)

Version 0.3 Kernel now has tty driver for 2 ASC channels
            Bug in ctxsw fixed (wasn't restoring interrupt status)
			qdf can run as a process

Version 0.2 First kernel release. Multitasking works (sort of)
			Timer interrupt & sleep queues OK.

Version 0.1 (i.e. very young, and probably full'o'bugs). qdf only.

Written by David Haworth (dave&fen-net.de) Bug reports
and other messages accepted. I'll try my best to reply
and even to fix the bugs, but I can't guarantee anything.

Please read the files in the doc and arch-doc subdirectories
before attempting to use the programs in this archive.

If you find the code useful and want to incorporate it into
your own non-GPL programs, please contact me for permission.
I might consider releasing the code under the less restrictive
LGPL if there's demand.
