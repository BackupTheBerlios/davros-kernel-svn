To compile the programs, all you need is the standard GNU CC for
x86. If you're using Linux, it's probably already installed.
All the development work has been carried out on a Linux host,
but should also work on Solaris provided you have the cross-
compiler and GNU Make installed. You'll probably need Linux
to make the boot disks though.

To build the programs:

1. Unpack the archive into a suitable directory. If you're
reading this file, you've probably already done that.

2. Edit the Makefile in the top level directory. Change the
names of the assembler, compiler and linker (AS, CC and LD)
to match your compiler. (Already OK for Linux)

3. In the top level directory, type "make bin/davros" for the
kernel + qdf interpreter or "make bin/kerntest" for the kernel test
suite. The binaries (in the bin directory) can then be loaded into the
CPU and started.

4. Have fun!
