How to boot Davros on your old PC.
==================================

1. Download a copy fo GrUB from the FSF ftp site. I've been using
   version 0.91.
   Build as required. I have the ne and 3com network drivers
   compiled in, and I'm booting Davros from my main PC over tftp.

2. Insert a blank floppy, become root, and type these commands:
      fdformat /dev/f0
      mke2fs /dev/fd0
      mount -t ext2fs /dev/fd0 /floppy
      grub-install --root-directory=/floppy '(fd0)'
   Then edit /floppy/boot/grub/device.map to remove the hd entry.
   Afterwards run the grub-install command again.
   You might have to adjust the commands to suit your host.
   *** WARNING *** be careful. You could destroy your
   system if you mistyped these commands!

3. Create the file /floppy/boot/grub/menu.lst. Here's mine:
      serial --unit=0 --speed=9600
      terminal serial console
      default 0
      ifconfig --address=192.168.8.2 --server=192.168.8.3

      title Boot /davros from network
      root (nd)
      kernel /davros

   Using this config, grub will run over a serial line, so you
   don't need a monitor on the PC. Davros uses the serial lines
   too - there's no support for the PC's console at the moment.
   There are also options in grub to boot from the floppy or even
   the hard disk. Read the manual.

4. *** Important *** before ejecting the floppy, unmount it:
      umount /floppy

5. Set up the tftp server on your PC. You'll probably need to edit
   /etc/inetd.conf to enable it and to set the root directory.
   If your host is connected to the internet you'd be advised to
   use a firewall to prevent access to the tftp server from
   outside.

6. Copy your davros kernel to the tftp root directory.

7. Boot your target PC from the floppy, and select the
   "davros" entry from the menu.
